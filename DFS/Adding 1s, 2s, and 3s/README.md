<h1>Adding 1s, 2s, and 3s   </h1>

Integer 4 can be expressed as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 3s in seven different ways as follows:

>1+1+1+1,   
>1+1+2,   
1+2+1,   
2+1+1,   
2+2,   
1+3, and   
3+1.


Write a program that determines the number of ways in which a given integer can be expressed as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 3s. You may assume that the integer is positive and less than 11.  

# input   
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T ) is given in the first line of the input file. Each test case consists of an integer written in a single line.   

# output   
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain an integer representing the number of ways.   

# example   
> 3             
4   
7   
10      
  
> 7   
44   
274
