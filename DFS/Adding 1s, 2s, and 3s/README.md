#Adding 1s, 2s, and 3s
Integer 4 can be expressed as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 3s in seven different ways as follows:

>1+1+1+1,   
>1+1+2,   
1+2+1,   
2+1+1,   
2+2,   
1+3, and   
3+1.


Write a program that determines the number of ways in which a given integer can be expressed as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 3s. You may assume that the integer is positive and less than 11.
